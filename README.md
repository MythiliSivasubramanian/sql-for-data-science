# SQL for Data Science – From Basics

This repo is my personal daily learning tracker in **SQL specially for Data Science**.

I am starting from absolute basics and moving step by step towards advanced SQL used in real data science roles.

Each phase contains small lessons.  

Every lesson has:
- SQL queries  
- Clear comments  
- Simple explanations  
- Practice examples
